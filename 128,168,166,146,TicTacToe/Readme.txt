In order to run our code you would have to run the file named ttt.cpp. the instructions are simple enough. Do read the instructions on both the console window and graphic window if you need any help.As a headsup I would like to inform you that the game runs on console window and the menu navigations are active for the graphic window. Hope you enjoy it.
